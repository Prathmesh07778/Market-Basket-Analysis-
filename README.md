# 🛒 Market Basket Analysis

Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to uncover associations between items in large datasets of transactions. This project demonstrates how to use the **Apriori algorithm** to discover frequent itemsets and generate association rules.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze customer purchasing behavior
- Discover frequent itemsets using the Apriori algorithm
- Generate meaningful association rules
- Visualize support, confidence, and lift of rules

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses a sample dataset of market transactions (can be customized). Each row represents a customer's purchase containing one or more items.

You can use datasets from:
- [Kaggle - Market Basket Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Or your own transactional data

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prathmesh07778/Market-Basket-Analysis-.git
   cd Market-Basket-Analysis-
   
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the analysis script or notebook:
  python market_basket.py
Or open the notebook in Jupyter:
  jupyter notebook

🧠 Techniques Used
Apriori Algorithm (via mlxtend)

Association Rule Mining

Support, Confidence, and Lift metrics

Data preprocessing with pandas

Visualization using matplotlib or seaborn

📈 Example Output
Frequently bought items:
  Milk & Bread (Support: 0.3)

Strong association rule:
  If a customer buys Milk → likely to buy Bread (Confidence: 80%)


🚀 Future Improvements
Add GUI/dashboard for real-time analysis

Connect to a live retail database

Optimize rule generation for large-scale datasets

Try FP-Growth or ECLAT algorithms for performance comparison
